## **Data Science Labs**
This repository contains a series of programming assignments from my Data Science course at Tulane University done in Jupyter notebooks. Each lab focuses on a concept or technique in data science to provide experience with practical tools and algorithms. The labs contain an introduction to the topic and exercises pertaining to the topic at the bottom of the notebook.

This repository includes eight labs: a classification lab, an evaluating models lab, a merging and joining data lab, a probability lab, a regression model lab, a scraping lab, a distance metrics lab, and a transforming and comparing data lab.

### **Lab Descriptions**
#### **Classification Lab**
The objective of this lab is to train a classification model to make categorical predictions based on elements associated with a variable. Classification model training is done by calculating distances between the value and the k-nearest neighbors. This lab also focuses on evaluating the prediction model by finding the precision and recall values of the model.

#### **Evalutating Models Lab**
The objective of this lab is to evaluate a regression model using the training error. This lab also focuses on overfitting and test error pertaining to regression model evaluation.

#### **Merging and Joining Data Lab**
The objective of the transforming and comparing data lab is to explore different types of joins (inner, outer, left, right) and how they can be used to combine datasets. This lab focuses on managing structured data and identifying patterns within different datasets.

#### **Probability Lab**
The objective of this lab is to visualize relationships between multiple variables in a dataset using the joint, marginal, and conditional distributions for two variables. This lab also looks at the independence of two variables.

#### **Regression Model Lab**
The objective of this lab is to create regression models using k-nearest neighbors of a value from a dataset. This lab focuses on predicting values in a data set by fitting a model using training data.

#### **Scraping Lab**
The objective of this lab is to practice web scraping and parsing using the requests and Beautiful Soup libraries. This lab focuses on using these libraries to retrieve data from websites and extract information from HTML content.

#### **Distance Metrics Lab**
The objective of this lab is to measure relationships between observations in a dataset by quantifying the similarity of a pair of observations using distance metrics. This lab focuses on finding the Manhattan distance and Euclidean distance, comparing the similarity based on distances, and scaling variables.

#### **Transforming and Comparing Data Lab**
The objective of this lab is to explore techniques for transforming data to derive new insights about datasets. This includes applying transformations to make variables more manageable for analysis and visualizing the transformations to identify patterns in datasets.
