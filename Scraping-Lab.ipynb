The server then sends back either the contents of that page with a HTTP code `200`, meaning everything worked, or it sends back an error like `404`, meaning that you asked for a page it doesn't know how to find. You can read more about [HTTP Error codes here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes).\n",

Specifically it knows how to read HTML tables, using the [read_html()](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_html.html) function. There are quite a few gotchas with working with HTML so for any page you want to read you'll have to make sure the table is well formatted, and that the Pandas function is working.\n",

If there are many different styles of table on a page, then we could pass this into Beautiful Soup to only find those tables that have that class property, as we do in the next example."

However, you've been cramming pizza as part of your study routine so you can't right-click the mouse any more. So we'll need to write a parser to go read the webpage, grab all the links in the lectures table, and only keep the ones that end in `.pdf` ... Easy right?\n",

Back in the olden days, one could iterate through all the tags on the webpage to get at the same information, but it would be a lot harder.

This is a much more manual process but it serves to illustrate how tough this can be."
